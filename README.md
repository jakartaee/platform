# Jakarta EE Platform Project

This is the project for the Jakarta EE Platform specification.  The Jakarta
EE Platform specification is the umbrella specification that defines
the Jakarta EE platform.  The platform specification doesn't define the
Jakarta EE APIs directly, but rather includes them by reference to other
Jakarta specifications and defines how they all fit together in the
overall Jakarta EE platform.  The platform specification also defines
other attributes of the platform such as security, deployment,
transactions, and interoperability.

not at the GitHub source code repository README view, so that the links in

## API Specifications and Javadocs

The [Specifications](Specifications) page contains links to the project
pages for all Jakarta EE specifications.

The API Javadocs for the Jakarta EE platform are collected together here:

* [Jakarta EE APIs](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/platform/8/apidocs/)
* [Jakarta Server Faces Tag Libraries](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/faces/2.3/vdldoc/)
* [Jakarta Server Faces Standard HTML RenderKit](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/faces/2.3/renderkitdoc)
* [Jakarta Server Faces JavaScript Documentation](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/faces/2.3/jsdoc)

## Jakarta EE 9 (under development)

The [Jakarta EE 9](jakartaee9/JakartaEE9) page contains links to the documentation and processes required for a successful Jakarta EE 9 release.

## Jakarta EE 8 (latest release)

Java EE 8 was approved by the Jakarta EE Specification Committee
on Sep 10, 2019.
The final specification is available for download on the
[Jakarta EE specification page](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/platform/8/).

## Project Communication

You can track all the platform project communication by
subscribing to the jakartaee-platform-dev mailing list.
To subscribe, or to browse the archives, see the
[jakartaee-platform-dev page](https://accounts.eclipse.org/mailing-list/jakartaee-platform-dev).

You can find the drafts of proposals and other working
documents on the [Documents](Documents) page.
(Currently this contains only historical Java EE proposals.)

### Meeting minutes

The Platform Project holds regular meetings.  The [meeting minutes](minutes) provides information on time, location, decisions, and frequency.

## Compatibility Requirements

The rules we follow to ensure backwards compatibility when revising
Jakarta EE specifications are described on the
[Compatibility Requirements](CompatibilityRequirements) page.

## JCP Processes

The use of JCP processes by the Java EE group at Oracle is described on the
[JCP Processes](JCPProcesses) page.
(This page has not been updated to reflect the Jakarta EE Specification Process.)

## Annotation Rules

Annotations are used heavily in the Jakarta EE programming model.
It's important that all Jakarta EE specifications define and use
annotations in a consistent way.
We've written up some [DRAFT rules on how annotations work](AnnotationRules).
