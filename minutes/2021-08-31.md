## Agenda and Minutes

### Jakarta EE 10 (standing agenda item)

* Core Profile PR: https://github.com/jakartaee/specifications/pull/419 
* Scott will add the release plan for Core to the project web page (gh-pages)
* Scott will send out email with the target dates from the plan to project leads list
* No feedback yet to the resolution regarding optional components of a Specification
  * No new optional features will be allowed
* Start tracking progress of the specifications
  * Use the spreadsheet in the spec committee
  * We will also use a GH project board for this
  * Will the waves be similar? 
    * Dependencies between the APIs are the same, so that is expected for EE 10 as well
    * How far we get with the TCK dependencies (circular) remains to be seen
* First TCK calls on September 8   
  * Two calls to cover all time zones
  * [Calendar link](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=eclipse-foundation.org_e9ki8t2gc75sh07qdh95c8ofvc@group.calendar.google.com) 
  * [Agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V1dDLJkd14EDRMPeuI0VzPtU4Lbli8FFBd1pLDLlOrY/edit#)
* Identify implementations used for ratification in the ballots
  * TODO: Check if a project board can be used for this mapping
  * Or add a column to the tracking spreadsheet
* TCK Guides will need to be updated

### Semantic versioning of component specifications (continued)

* Discussion continued on mailing list
* No objections regarding semantic versioning
* Some concerns regarding the dependencies suggested for tooling support (e.g osgi Version annotation)
* Could be put forward as a recommendation, rather than a requirement
  * Get feedback from the projects adopting it
  * Set up some guidelines and ask for projects to volunteer (Config?)
  * Option to add this under the Jakarta namespace (instead of OSGI) at Jakarta Annotations
  * Potentially add as a platform requirement at a later stage
* **Signature tests must still work**
  * Tooling changes likely to be updated to accept this type of annotations in the API classes
  * Must have agreement that this is a kind of change we want to do
* Not in the scope for EE 10

### JavaDocs -- and other ancillary material (i.e. Spec., TCK User Guide - ascii-doc builds) working with JDK 11 (Ed)

* When we run into issues running with JDK11, we will need to start working with the project teams case-by-case
* Be proactive and run the javadoc+ jobs under JDK11 as soon as possible
  * Scott will create an issue for the platform javadoc
* Strongly encourage project teams to start running their builds on JDK 11 as soon as possible
* Ed will run the TCK user guides builds (check status with Gurunandan Rao)
