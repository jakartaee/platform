## Jakarta EE 12

* MP update  
  * Discussed plans for minor release for MP 7.2  
  * Minor release update for MP Config  
  * Jakarta EE 10 and 11 should both be tested  
  * May need two versions of the parent  
  * Loosely coupling between MP and Jakarta today to support different Jakarta versions  
  * More to be discussed at the next MP technical meeting  
* Component specs  
  * Data could publish M2 without using the new version of the plugin, but we want to get that working  
  * Gavin put out [a post](https://x.com/1ovthafew/status/2018603429502013938?s=20) about Hibernate 8 support of Persistence 4.0 M1  
* Glassfish for EE 12  
  * Only a subset of team seems to be working to support things for running platform  
  * Finishing up EE 11 support which is priority of course  
  * Other products can also be a compatible implementation, but need to know content fully before we will know more
