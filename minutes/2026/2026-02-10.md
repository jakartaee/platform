## Jakarta EE 12

* Thoughts of schedule and milestone dates going forward  
  * M3 Feb 15 to Mar 31  
  * M4 Apr  1 to May 15  
  * M5 May 16 to Jun 30 – possibly Core profile here  
  * M6 Jul  1 to Aug 15  
  * M7 Aug 15 to Sep 30 – ideally we release here or soon after  
  * M8 Oct  1 to Nov 15  
  * **WE DO NOT WANT TO GO INTO 2027 – Steering committee backed**  
* Compatible implementation is the main issue here of course still  
  * Vendors still working on their EE 11 releases  
  * Glassfish was the ratifying implementation for EE 11\.  Took 6 months since then to get a final release though that just completed recently  
  * Component spec implementations that historically had mostly Oracle committers and many of them are no longer with Oracle.  
    * Glassfish depends on these implementations for their implementation  
    * EclipseLink is an important one with all the updates in Persistence 4.0 and Data 1.1’s dependency on persistence  
    * Parsson and Yasson also are concerning  
    * Glassfish has a small team as well  
  * M2 date is not listed above.  Can consider it for Feb 14 at this point.  🙂  
    * Platform doesn’t have a M1 or M2 release.  Component specs have release some M1 and M2’s  
    * There is some concern about which of the component specs will make it into the platform due to the concerns raised above  
  * Standalone vs in container TCK testing  
    * Persistence has two copies of the TCK – standalone and in container  
    * JSON-B and JSON-P TCK only have standalone tests currently and doesn’t run in the container  
    * Data has two run modes – standalone and in container  
    * Could arquillian have a JavaSE mode?  
  * Some component spec TCKs are still in platform TCK repo  
    * Ideally they would move to their component spec repository to make easy to maintain  
    * Persistence resists this move due to the in container testing, but that wouldn’t need to be run for compatibility testing of the component spec alone  
      * [https://github.com/jakartaee/persistence/issues/403](https://github.com/jakartaee/persistence/issues/403)  
    * Having spec, api and tck in the same repo makes it easy to put them all in at the same time for an update to the API / spec  
  * Specs running independent of CDI in standalone TCK vs relying on CDI innately in the specification and then having the tests with CDI  
    * Specs need to have their list of dependencies and have their TCK testing include those dependencies as part of their tests, but doesn’t need the entire profile / platform to test  
  * Would need to have component specs ratified by August for including in a platform compatible implementation for EE 12\.  EclipseLink for example  
    * Concern about TCK for persistence for instance since it appears that there are not tests added to the TCK yet  
  * Many vendors use EclipseLink, but there are limited committers from those vendors in the EclipseLink community  
    * Project leaders for EclipseLink appear to be mostly not around any more / inactive except Dmitry.  Some should move to Historical committers probably  
    * Project team needs to adjust their leader and committer lists  
* MP update  
  * MP 7.2 is pushing for Q3 2026 release at the earliest  
  * MP Technical call is today  
  * MicroProfile (Config) Future Directions call within Jakarta Future Directions on 5th of February – [recording](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetingrecap?driveId=b%215ewTgB-bTkqRBdk6OK1Y4tl33buY1ppIjJ6YzVPowtSGMMk4XD3tTJakhf0n1zQg&driveItemId=01P25IBAPK3AJU5XYB4NCKOTC6HC2Z7BS3&sitePath=https%3A%2F%2Fibm-my.sharepoint.com%2F%3Av%3A%2Fp%2Fneilp_ca%2FIQDq2BNO3wHjRKdMXji1n4ZbAVPNVE5iDfW1O1yTfZWwuFM&fileUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fibm-my.sharepoint.com%2F%3Av%3A%2Fp%2Fneilp_ca%2FIQDq2BNO3wHjRKdMXji1n4ZbAVPNVE5iDfW1O1yTfZWwuFM&iCalUid=040000008200E00074C5B7101A82E00807E90815990AC6EE27F0DB01000000000000000010000000FC1A23F8C441FE44A79A0BCF05358F07&masterICalUid=040000008200E00074C5B7101A82E00800000000990AC6EE27F0DB01000000000000000010000000FC1A23F8C441FE44A79A0BCF05358F07&threadId=19%3Ameeting_NDU4MWZjMjQtYjY5NC00N2I2LTlhNGMtMDBiMGE1ZWMwNWM5%40thread.v2&organizerId=fd0e9aeb-c458-4f23-b502-4b2e4fa1284f&tenantId=fcf67057-50c9-4ad4-98f3-ffca64add9e9&callId=8996a435-cb99-4706-9ea9-876d5304c0bd&threadType=Meeting&meetingType=Recurring&subType=RecapSharingLink_RecapChiclet).
