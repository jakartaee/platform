## Top of mind for Jared, James

* [30 new platform CCRs](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3Acertification) came in over the holidays for EE 8, 10 and 11\.  
  * Two additional ones are still there from previous weeks  
* OSSRH status  
  * Kyle ran into some problems trying out the new plugin  
  * Ran into problems with authenticating in jenkins when running maven commands  
  * Kyle and others will try now that people are back from holiday

## Jakarta EE 12

* Jan 27 is target for M2 for EE 12  
  * Anything we can do on the platform side to make sure stuff is happening over the next weeks to progress M2 for component specs?  
  * Need to progress OSSRH, try out the new plugin and make sure your token is working  
  * Once someone has it working (maybe Kyle) send a message to the mailing list to inform others steps to take – platform mailing and the component spec leads mailing lists  
* MP has meeting today
