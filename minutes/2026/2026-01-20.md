## Top of mind for Jared, James

* OSSRH status  
  * Draft PR: [https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/ee4j/pull/115](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/ee4j/pull/115)   
    * Introduces 3 profiles to be used by components to be able to stage, promote and use staged artifacts  
    * It is a work in progress because it doesn’t work yet, but at least it is a start  
  * Working through any other bugs via the Data project to stage/publish an M2  
* [Remaining CCRs](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3Acertification) to be approved  
  * SHA issues with the EE 11 Payara ones  
  * Follow up from last week:  [review checklist](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/wiki/Compatibility_Certification_Request_CCR_Review_Guidance) already exists for people to review CCRs

## Jakarta EE 12

* NoSQL status if Otavio joins  
  * Updates on driver inclusion  
  * Also there is a dependency on MP / Jakarta Config in the current spec  
* MP / MP Config status  
  * Technical call was last week  
  * Discussing have a new MP release  
    * Discussing splitting up MP Config spec into two parts as part of this release – Core Config function and CDI enablement function  
    * Looking to spec some function existing in MP Config implementations  
  * Jan is working on proposals for moving MP and/or MP Config to Jakarta  
    * Call for involvement from both MP and Jakarta working groups  
    * Looking for a solution that satisfies both groups  
    * Looking for a channel for doing this work.    
      * CN4J has been dropped.   
      * Jakarta Future Interests group as an option?  
* Schedule adjustment  
  * Considering a reset of EE 12 schedule in light of discussions last week  
    * Vendors busy with EE 11 implementations  
    * Since users cannot use EE 11 easily yet due to vendors finishing implementations, no one is clamoring for EE 12  
    * Limited function in EE 12 so far would make for a very small release with the current schedule  
      * For example, with the current schedule, the REST spec was looking to hardly do anything for REST and not get the new CDI function in  
  * If there is contention and not consensus, there is a possible need for a vote  
  * If we staged the profiles / platform like EE 11, we could have Core Profile come out earlier to get closer to 2 years after EE 11 Core Profile  
    * For a 2 year cadence, June 2027 would be 2 years after the EE 11 platform was released  
  * Some other specs are feeling rush with the deadlines  
  * ACTION:  Jared / James will work to come up with a new proposed timeline for EE 12  
* Open floor  
  * Michael working on updating the starter
