## Top of mind for Jared, James

* OSSRH  
  * Draft PR: [https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/ee4j/pull/115](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/ee4j/pull/115)   
  * Kyle got staging to work for data 1.1 M2 artifact.  Still need to be able to delete staged resources which is not part of the plugin yet.    
    * Can we just push a new one without deleting?  Does overwrite work?  
      * Overwriting does work\! 👍  
    * New option added overnight from Seb called nexus-drop to remove a staged artifact.  Won’t be adding a new profile for dropping.  
      * central-staging-plugins 1.4.0 version was released during the call  
  * When ready to promote data 1.1 M2 to maven (sync goal), will try that portion of the change and can put the PR up for review to be merged  
* Ivar accepted and closed out all remaining CCRs that all reached their 2 week auto-accept date

## Jakarta EE 12

* Request to strengthen the Jakarta EE 12 documentation ([mail from Otavio](https://www.eclipse.org/lists/jakarta.ee-spec/msg04243.html))  
  * Adding clear explanations and code example to the specifications for customers to be able to understand more clearly on why and how to use new functions  
  * Data and NoSQL 1.1 are examples of where this is being done.  
  * Need to make sure that they are real examples and not aspirational of what we “think” the code will look like but it isn’t complete yet.  Need to make sure that the examples are updated to be how things were finalized in the specification.  
* Question about EE 11 and EE 10 API differences in [slack](https://eclipsefoundationhq.slack.com/archives/CK4UW9DPS/p1769251322563079?thread_ts=1768971241.756229&cid=CK4UW9DPS) in \#general on January 20  
  * We could in EE 12 create a BOM comparison of the API to be able to document what is different from an API perspective.  Scott will open an [issue](https://github.com/jakartaee/jakartaee-api/issues) for this idea.  See [https://github.com/jakartaee/jakartaee-api/issues/199](https://github.com/jakartaee/jakartaee-api/issues/199)  
* Persistence 4.0 M1 was created last week  
* MP / MP config discussions  
  * Feb 5 will have Jakarta Futures discussion about MP / MP Config to talk about technical solutions  
  * Planning to have a 7.2 release later this year, probably second half.  Point update to a couple of different component specifications.  
* Schedule adjustment discussions continued  
  * Today was supposed to be M2 deadline  
  * No component specs released a M2 except maybe 1 spec  
  * Platform has not released anything for M1 or M2.  
  * Specs can release Milestone releases at their schedule and do not need to release at the same time as platform is “dictating”.  
  * May / June 2026 seems unattainable right now with the current content.  
  * Plan was to have 2 years between release.    
    * 6 to 9 months past the Java LTS is the original plan.    
    * June 2024 was the original plan for EE 11\.    
    * For 2 years after would be June 2026, but we didn’t release the platform until June 2025\.    
    * Splitting the difference, would say December 2026\.  
    * If we move dates, we need to stick to them.  
  * Good to bring it up with the Steering committee and marketing committees to understand the impact to Jakarta EE  
  * It would be good to have a release plan for 2 years that is repeatable moving forward for each release so that it is consistent and not surprising.  Similar to how the JDK team does things for their releases  
  * Having an EE 12 implementation is needed in order to finalize specifications.  That is a limiting factor.  
    * Vendors are finishing up their EE 11 implementations and have completing priorities which doesn’t help  
    * If we set a date and have limited content, it makes it easier for vendors to implement of course  
  * From a component spec perspective, would be good to have dates to know how to plan for what to include in the specification  
    * Whether to include CDI replacement for @Context in REST is an example  
  * Some component specifications are rather quiet in the mailing list and not meeting at all is not helpful in progressing specifications  
* NoSQL update from Otavio about driver support  
  * Need to get buy in from vendors to provide implementations and maintain them  
  * May need to engage with the marketing committee to evangelize / attract with vendors  
* Jakarta EE 12 \- Robust and Flexible ([image link](https://www.agilejava.eu/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Jakarta_EE_12.png))![][image1]  
  * Current thought from a marketing perspective for EE 12  
  * It could be revised with other ideas  
  * Current image link is from Ivar’s site, also available in [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1krzJ4v_CV81yZqFZ17NJ7dM3uKMw2RTy?usp=drive_link)  
* [jakarta.ee](http://jakarta.ee) web page has been updated by the marketing committee with a new template / design.  More changes are coming.  If you have any thoughts / changes you think would be helpful, let people know.  [github.com/jakartaee/jakarta.ee](http://github.com/jakartaee/jakarta.ee) to file a bug. You can also use [jakarta.ee-marketing@eclipse.org](mailto:jakarta.ee-marketing@eclipse.org)  to provide feedback.
