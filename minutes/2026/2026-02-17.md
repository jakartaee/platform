## Top of mind for Jared, James

* OSSRH update  
  * PR: [https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/ee4j/pull/115](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/ee4j/pull/115)   
  * Help desk issue:  [https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipsefdn/helpdesk/-/issues/6890](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipsefdn/helpdesk/-/issues/6890)  
  * PR is merged  
  * Now just need a new release – Ivar is trying today (Monday)  
    * [https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/org.eclipse.ee4j/project/2.0.0](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/org.eclipse.ee4j/project/2.0.0)   
  * 2.0.0 is released and projects can now use that for publishing their artifacts to staging and maven central  
* No new CCRs this week  
  * Expect to have a Glassfish 8 CCR in the near future


## Jakarta EE 12

* Arjan working on enabling snapshots in some of the projects to enable implementations to make use of the new APIs for experimentation  
  * Need milestone builds as well for products to pick up and get repeatable results  
  * Staging is also now available for us to be do early staging of milestones as well that can be used for experimentation and validation of the changes  
    * Question about expiration of staged resources with the new way of doing things.    
    * Need to follow up with Eclipse help desk to get see if the new staging has a retention policy  
    * Most components have clean up of their staged resources when they are promoted to be published to maven  
* Eclipse has brought up about some projects being mostly quiet and not needing to run CIs frequently  
  * [https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipsefdn/helpdesk/-/issues/7031](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipsefdn/helpdesk/-/issues/7031)  
  * [https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipsefdn/helpdesk/-/issues/7015](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipsefdn/helpdesk/-/issues/7015)  
  * Could we combine projects for some of the more stable / mature specs like interceptors  
  * May do releases every 3 years.  After 3 years things then keys expire etc  
  * Interceptors could be built with CDI, but still be its own specification  
  * Could we disable a CI job until it is needed?  
  * Eclipse possibly could assign the shared resources to multiple CI jobs and allow for queuing between some of these not less / mature specifications  
* M3 started this week for platform (Feb 15 to March 30\)  
* Platform goals this milestone?  
  * Component specs move to the new version of the parent POM  
  * Get jakartaee API jar populated with component spec milestones  
  * Remove SecurityManager usage in APIs [1018](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/issues/1018)  
    * Mostly there except for batch as long as specs get releases done  
  * Deprecate Application Client [1015](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/issues/1015)  
  * Typo fix for Persistence / CDI integration [1150](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/issues/1150)  
  * Work with Persistence specification for [1135](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/issues/1135)  
  * Research JNDI usage and alternatives for [1105](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/issues/1105)   
    * Need to have alternatives for all JNDI usage before could deprecate  
    * Quarkus doesn’t make use of JNDI so there may be alternatives or they just don’t support those functions that require JNDI.  Possible things that can be discussed  
    * ResourceRef for instance for configuring shared vs unsharable connections.  What do they use to configure it.  Possibly config properties?  
    * Do we need Jakarta Config then to help with alternatives for JNDI?  
  * Update platform specification to point to new versions that have provided a milestone release  
  * [https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3AEE12](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3AEE12)  
  * CI jobs running Core Profile TCK 11 (12 snapshot maybe even) with Java 21 and Java 25 (may need fixes for running Java 25  
    * Discuss more tomorrow at the Platform TCK call  
* Persistence 4.0 TCK commits, not a lot but some changes.  
  * [https://github.com/jakartaee/persistence/commit/0abddc6d05d1829bb8e88221396702db35814f73](https://github.com/jakartaee/persistence/commit/0abddc6d05d1829bb8e88221396702db35814f73) \- add validation callbacks  
  * [https://github.com/jakartaee/persistence/commit/fb8490bb85fa3a6e8f865e04771680b3ea0867a9](https://github.com/jakartaee/persistence/commit/fb8490bb85fa3a6e8f865e04771680b3ea0867a9) fix tck build  
  * [https://github.com/jakartaee/persistence/commit/472d0a536e1d6b99ecd22e2fd21915a46c4164c6](https://github.com/jakartaee/persistence/commit/472d0a536e1d6b99ecd22e2fd21915a46c4164c6) another tck fix change.  
* Persistence 3.2 TCK release expected soon to address TCK challenges.  
* NoSQL  
  * Depends on Config which isn’t available yet for Jakarta EE  
  * Still want to hear about whether will have driver support and community implementations  
* Persistence 4.0  
  * EclipseLink is low on committers  
  * Should vendors consider the alternative of Hibernate for EE 12?  
  * Lukas seems to still be active even though not at Oracle any longer  
  * If Glassfish wants to stick with EclipseLink, that can be a blocker for GlassFish to be the ratifying implementation for EE 12  
  * Need to engage with some of the other vendors that depend on EclipseLink.  Chinese vendors have a dependency on EclipseLink as well.  
  * Payara helped in the past (EE 9\) with GlassFish implementation in the past to get it to be a ratifying implementation  
* Config update  
  * [https://github.com/jakartaee/jakartaee-future-directions/blob/main/README.md](https://github.com/jakartaee/jakartaee-future-directions/blob/main/README.md) has the transcript from the futures call  
  * There is also a recording from the MP technical call last week
