## Agenda and Minutes

### [IG] Individual Specifications Plan Reviews

* Deadline for potential inclusion in 9.1: January 31
*Ä None so far
* Rumors that Jakarta REST will have a release
* Others?
  * Activation - No API changes, only minor JavaDocs and “build stuff” -> will mail, jaxb, jaxrs need to update dependencies to the latest version?
  * Do we need a release review for a patch release (service release)? Check with the specification committee.  Add this to the agenda for tomorrow’s (01/13/2021) meeting.
    * We want to be able to release bug fixes/errata releases without going through the entire process of releasing a specification version.

### Jakarta EE 9.1

* Proposed 9.1 Release Plan:  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fEf-Iio2-NJSfMuNc1rpCxIMdA6tlUyv8d2c4TydMt0/edit# 
* Discussed the ORB References section in Jakarta Enterprise Beans. Removing this section will require a minor release of this specification. Making it optional will also require an update.
* Jakarta EE 9.1 TCK needs to allow execution with either Java SE 8 or Java SE 11.

_Items below were not discussed_

### Jakarta EE 9.NEXT
