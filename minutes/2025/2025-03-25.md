## Agenda

### Top of mind for Ed, Arjan, Jared

* [JEA-499-WebProfile EE 11 release](https://dev.azure.com/jakarta-ee-azdo/jakarta-ee-azdo/_workitems/edit/499)  
  * [JEA 508](https://dev.azure.com/jakarta-ee-azdo/jakarta-ee-azdo/_workitems/edit/508) CI job optimizations. Can we close this?  
  * [JEA 505](https://dev.azure.com/jakarta-ee-azdo/jakarta-ee-azdo/_workitems/edit/505) Mentor actions  
* EE 11 Web Profile ballot has started. [Mailing list link](https://www.eclipse.org/lists/jakarta.ee-spec/msg03721.html).  
  * [https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/glassfish/main/distributions/web/8.0.0-JDK17-M10/web-8.0.0-JDK17-M10.zip](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/glassfish/main/distributions/web/8.0.0-JDK17-M10/web-8.0.0-JDK17-M10.zip) isn’t listed in the ratifying implementation list on the EE 11 Web profile page in [the release review PR](https://github.com/jakartaee/specifications/pull/802).  Shouldn’t it be?  
    * [https://github.com/jakartaee/specifications/pull/802\#discussion\_r2012332706](https://github.com/jakartaee/specifications/pull/802#discussion_r2012332706) review comment added to the PR to address the issue  
      * Accepted  
  * The earliest it can end is 7 days.  
  * It can only end when everyone has voted.  
  * Ivar will whip for votes starting next week.  
    * ACTION: Ed to create task for GOTV from Ivar.  
  * EE 11 Platform TCK work still remains  
* Jakarta Query is now in creation review ballot.  [Mailing list link](https://www.eclipse.org/lists/jakarta.ee-spec/msg03732.html).  
* Next week we are back to unified daylight savings time across the geos

### TCK Refactoring Jakarta EE 11

* Now that the Web Profile ballot has started, we can resume the work for the Platform Profile TCK in earnest. Where do we stand with this?

### Jakarta EE 11

* No other business this week on EE 11\.   
* ELAwareBeanManager TCK tests [in this PR](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/pull/2083) did not make the Web Profile TCK so will have to have those tests only in the Platform TCK since cannot add tests in a service release.  
  * Scott opened an issue to make sure in EE 12 that we move them back to web profile.

### Jakarta EE 12

* Release plan status ([see board](https://github.com/orgs/jakartaee/projects/17))  
  * Reminder of April 15 date for creating a release plan or deciding that not planning an update to your component in EE 12  
  * CDI 5.0 and Data 1.1 passed their release plan ballots  
  * Pages 4.1, WebSocket 2.3 and Faces 5.0 are now in ballot  
  * Servlet 6.2 and Expression Language 6.1 are in mentor review  
* Given recent developments regarding MicroProfile and Jakarta integration, discussion about Config will be paused until those developments are more resolved.  
* Jakarta HTTP  
  * Arjan proposal early draft?  
  * Looking to have something now by end of week  
* Concurrency component community review ends today so should move toward ballot soon  
* REST is an important specification to have updates in EE 12 to make things all CDI centric and deprecate @Context  
  * ACTION:  James Perkins to kick off a conversation to move forward with a release plan  
    * [https://www.eclipse.org/lists/rest-dev/msg00336.html](https://www.eclipse.org/lists/rest-dev/msg00336.html)  
* Specification combining discussions  
  * Pages 4.1  
    * During the platform meetings we had discussed merging Pages, Tags and Debugging into a single specification  
    * Tomcat does not implement Tags, but only Pages  
    * Currently Mark Thomas would not want to do this change, but would not object if someone else implemented it  
    * See [this comment](https://github.com/jakartaee/specifications/pull/804#issuecomment-2748704175) to see some context about this discussion.  
    * Debugging specification / content is in the pages repo currently so it could easily be merged in since they are already tied in github  
  * Pros and cons with combining specification or leaving them be more granular  
    * Implementations could choose to only do those they think have value  
    * Lots of specifications makes things more complex for the user to understand all the technologies  
    * Could do something like Pages Lite and Page Full like we did with CDI  
      * Pages Lite only has the content of the existing Pages  
      * Pages Full includes both Tags and Debugging support as well  
      * This approach could also be confusing for the end user  
    * Merging specifications then could require specifications to release even though only a part of it actually updated  
    * If specifications get too large, it is hard to see what actually changes in a new version  
  * CDI  
    * Similarly had discussion about combining Inject, CDI and Interceptors during the platform call as well in the past  
    * Jared asked the Inject community if they would want to combine it into CDI and they stated they would not want to do that.  
    * Interceptors would need to require updates in Enterprise Beans in order to combine Interceptors into CDI  
    * See [this comment](https://github.com/jakartaee/cdi/issues/856#issuecomment-2684148395) to see CDI stance on this question.  
  * Security  
    * Have discussed in the past about combining Security, Authentication and Authorization into a single specification  
    * Now that SOAP went away (from the platform), does Authentication need to be a separate specification from Security any longer?
