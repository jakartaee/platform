## Jakarta EE 12

* MicroProfile move to Jakarta is now in jeopardy due to recent discussions at the Jakarta Specification Committee.  
  * Straw poll for moving assets to Jakarta.  Two parties didn’t vote yet – Primeton and IBM.  4 members voted against it.  
  * Next consideration is to just move MP Config to Jakarta as a starting point  
  * Will be discussed in the MP community in coming weeks  
  * Namespace discussions still are sticking points (spec committee ballot hurt this discussion)  
  * Loss of control and influence of the MP specs has also been a concern (recent Jakarta working group session was helpful for this concern)  
* EE 12 milestone schedule with dates for each milestone end  
  * With goals for each milestone  
  * Wave schedule also with some specs in EE 12 that were not updated in EE 11
