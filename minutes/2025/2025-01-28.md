## Agenda

### Top of mind for Ed, Arjan, Jared

* ACTION: [JEA-494-tck-archive-format](https://dev.azure.com/jakarta-ee-azdo/jakarta-ee-azdo/_workitems/edit/494)  
* DONE: SecurityManager removal clarification text: [JEA-485-security-manager-clarity-text](https://dev.azure.com/jakarta-ee-azdo/jakarta-ee-azdo/_workitems/edit/485)

### TCK Refactoring Jakarta EE 11

* Will cover high level status today, but more detailed discussion will happen at the TCK call tomorrow  
* Discussed schedule last week at the TCK call  
  * Rough estimate that we can say is 1Q, but canâ€™t know that will be attainable due to resources  
* Alwin fixed the outstanding 9 JPA failures for Web Profile.    
  * Arjan has not run them yet, but will be doing so once he finishes up some tooling work.  
* TCK call Agenda for tomorrow:   
  * [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V1dDLJkd14EDRMPeuI0VzPtU4Lbli8FFBd1pLDLlOrY/edit?tab=t.0](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V1dDLJkd14EDRMPeuI0VzPtU4Lbli8FFBd1pLDLlOrY/edit?tab=t.0)  
* Mailing list question about CORBA, javax.CORBA and PortableRemoteObject being checked in signature test or not.    
  * These packages are not required by the platform any longer.  
* Release Core, Web, Platform together or independent?  
  * Core Profile is available except for the TCK archive discussed in top of mind  
  * Web Profile hope to complete 1Q and Platform hopefully by end of 2Q

### Jakarta EE 12

* [Issues labeled for Jakarta EE 12](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3AEE12)  
* Reach out to prospective specifications to gauge interest?  
  * Jakarta MVC  
    * Included in vendor implementations like glassfish \+ WildFly.  Not sure if used by customers  
    * Not sure if they have consumed EE 11 API  
    * May not be as popular with customers with new frameworks available  
  * Jakarta Config  
    * Concerns about integration with Config if added late and not used by component specs.  Part of why having this discussion early.  
    * Need to determine integration with MP Config  
      * CDI integration with Config does bring up some messiness.  May need different function for Core Profile vs Web / Platform  
      * Does Jakarta Config include all of what MP Config does or a subset of it?  
      * Been discussed at the MP technical calls the last few weeks  
      * May need to consider a Bridge spec (hosted in Jakarta or MP)  
    * Discussed moving MP Config directly to Jakarta Core Profile in the past  
      * RedHat opposed doing this move (RedHat does have vote for ballots)  
      * Governance and technical issues  
    * CN4J would be a place to have these types of discussions about Jakarta and MP Config   
  * Jakarta NoSQL  
    * Depends on Jakarta Config being included?  
    * Would be good to embraced by NoSQL vendors to have multiple implementations  
    * Currently have one implementation Eclipse JNoSQL   
      * Has proprietary Driver API   
      * Implementation has API above what is in the spec that may need to be moved to the spec API for completeness to allow to move to a 1.0 release  
      * Includes Jakarta Data integration  
    * Supported by Quarkus  
    * Open Liberty documents how to use NoSQL with the product  
    * Glassfish team would like to include it in the platform per Arjan  
    * If included in the platform, could have integration with Data and Security (as a new NoSQL DataStore)  
  * Jakarta RPC  
* Plan Reviews  
  * Data has a [1.1 release plan](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j.data/releases/1.1/plan) and has requested review  
  * Any other components working on release plans?  
    * Faces team started adding **EE12** label to issues  
* APIs with SecurityManager / AccessController / PrivilegedAction references ([Platform issue 1018](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/issues/1018))  
  * Activation ([issue](https://github.com/jakartaee/jaf-api/issues/125) and [PR](https://github.com/jakartaee/jaf-api/pull/169))  
  * Batch ([issue](https://github.com/jakartaee/batch/issues/215) and [PR](https://github.com/jakartaee/batch/pull/216))  
  * CDI ([issue](https://github.com/jakartaee/cdi/issues/831) and [PR](https://github.com/jakartaee/cdi/pull/830)) PR merged already  
  * JSON-P ([issue](https://github.com/jakartaee/jsonp-api/issues/403) and [PR](https://github.com/jakartaee/jsonp-api/pull/412))  
  * Mail ([issue](https://github.com/jakartaee/mail-api/issues/744) and [PR](https://github.com/jakartaee/mail-api/pull/745))  
  * Persistence ([issue](https://github.com/jakartaee/persistence/issues/666) and [PR](https://github.com/jakartaee/persistence/pull/664))  
  * REST ([issue](https://github.com/jakartaee/rest/issues/1262) and [PR](https://github.com/jakartaee/rest/pull/1295)) PR merged already  
  * Servlet ([issue](https://github.com/jakartaee/servlet/issues/789) and [PR](https://github.com/jakartaee/servlet/pull/790)) (just a javadoc update)  
  * Validation ([issue](https://github.com/jakartaee/validation/issues/242) and [PR](https://github.com/jakartaee/validation/pull/243)) (changes could be done in a service release since 3.1 was new in EE 11\)  
  * SOAP, XML Binding and XML Web Services also have references to SecurityManager artifacts and could be updated in a minor release independent of EE 12  
  * Connector has specification references that need to be cleaned up as well ([issue](https://github.com/jakartaee/connectors/issues/148))  
    * SecurityPermission annotation that may also need to be deprecated for removal.  Needs investigation

    

### Jakarta EE 11

* Validation 3.1  
  * [The PR](https://github.com/jakartaee/validation/pull/221) was merged in.  The xsd files are not part of the API jar.  Is the remaining work just to do the 3.1 equivalent of [https://github.com/jakartaee/jakarta.ee/pull/830](https://github.com/jakartaee/jakarta.ee/pull/830)?  Seems to be YES.
