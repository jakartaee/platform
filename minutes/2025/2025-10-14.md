## Jakarta EE 12

* [https://github.com/orgs/jakartaee/projects/20/views/1](https://github.com/orgs/jakartaee/projects/20/views/1) dashboard populated with M1 issues for each spec with an update for EE 12\.  
  * Aiming for October 15 for completion for M1  
  * Main concern is publishing  
  * 7 component specs have published M1 APIs and/or M1 specification documents / javadoc  
  * CDI has an Alpha1 from March  
  * Seeing things in [repo1.maven.org](http://repo1.maven.org), but not [repo.maven.apache.org](http://repo.maven.apache.org).  Is that expected?  
    * Concurrency is missing in [apache.org](http://apache.org).  Data doesn’t have this problem.  WEIRD\!\!\!  
    * It is in the metadata and can be accessed directly, but just isn’t in the index of the artifact URL  
* Jakarta and MicroProfile Update  
  * Emily sent a [proposal](https://www.eclipse.org/lists/jakartaee-platform-dev/msg04832.html) to the mailing list about MP joining Jakarta EE  
  * MP Steering committee call today  
  * Last few weeks there has been low attendance at the MP meetings due to this topic and travel due to fall conference season  
* Jakarta Connectors: removing the `@SecurityPermission` annotation and ra.xml deployment descriptor (Kyle Aure)  
  * Can this be removed, or does it need to be deprecated first?  
  * Does removing require updating the version to 3.0 instead of 2.2 which is what the current release plan version is?  
    * An annotation not being there isn’t a breaking change.  Applications do not fail with class loading errors due to an annotation not being found.  
    * Security 4.0 removed IdentityStorePermission without deprecating first  
    * Authentication 3.1 removed constants from jakarta.security.auth.message.config.AuthConfigFactory that were deprecated in 3.0  
  * I think it can be removed without deprecating first.  It only affects compiling of the code, but not runtime unless they are calling [SecurityPermission.XXX](http://SecurityManager.XXX) for some weird reason.  
  * Is it better to break them or for them to get the warning of deprecated use?  For security reasons maybe it is better to break them?  
  * Since they could get compile errors, it would be better to update the version number to be a major version update.  
  * Jakarta EE 11 already removed SecurityManager support  
  * Conclusion:  Can remove without deprecating, but should update the version numbering to 3.0 instead of 2.2.  
* Jakarta Connectors: Marlow: [https://github.com/jakartaee/connectors/issues/168](https://github.com/jakartaee/connectors/issues/168) \- \`Implication of read-only transactions on Jakarta Connectors specification\`?  
  * Also see Transactions 2.1 tracking issue [https://github.com/jakartaee/transactions/issues/220](https://github.com/jakartaee/transactions/issues/220) for read only transactions hint.  
  * Does it also impact Jakarta Messaging?  
    * It can use connectors and can do transactions  
    * With read only you wouldn’t consume a message?  
  * Enterprise Beans and Web containers obviously have transaction usage.  
    * There should be tests created for those technologies  
  * JDBC can use transactions  
    * JDBC testing is covered by the platform / web profile TCK and would need to have specific tests for this function  
  * Persistence is an obvious use of transactions that needs to have appropriate specification and testing updates  
  * New transaction test added to the platform TCK that is pending  
    * If a DB doesn’t support read only transactions the test is expected to pass still  
  * Transaction and platform community may need to open issues against other specifications to add specification language and test changes for the implications of read only transactions  
    * JDBC set read only on the connections needs to be discussed in the specification language  
    * Connectors may need a set read only mechanism  
  * Transaction issue is currently closed.  Will be re-opened to address these other concerns across the platform ecosystem  
    * Link to this conversation added to [https://github.com/jakartaee/transactions/issues/220\#issuecomment-3402481780](https://github.com/jakartaee/transactions/issues/220#issuecomment-3402481780)  
* TCK call is tomorrow.  Please attend.  Current schedule is 1st and 3rd Wednesday
