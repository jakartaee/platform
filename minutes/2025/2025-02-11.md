## Agenda

### Top of mind for Ed, Arjan, Jared

* Avoid any CN4J discussion.  
  * 1\. Ed believes this is irreconcilable.  
  * 2\. Ed believes any discussion about this topic in this forum would be unproductive.  
  * 3\. We have more important things to discuss.  
  * 4\. The “two lists” approach is the current plan of record, for config discussions.  
* ACTION: [JEA-494-tck-archive-format](https://dev.azure.com/jakarta-ee-azdo/jakarta-ee-azdo/_workitems/edit/494)

### TCK Refactoring Jakarta EE 11

* TCK call Agenda for tomorrow:   
  * [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V1dDLJkd14EDRMPeuI0VzPtU4Lbli8FFBd1pLDLlOrY/edit?tab=t.0](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V1dDLJkd14EDRMPeuI0VzPtU4Lbli8FFBd1pLDLlOrY/edit?tab=t.0)  
  * **These jobs are breaking**. Please be mindful when making changes to look at jobs:

### Jakarta EE 12

* [Issues labeled for Jakarta EE 12](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3AEE12)  
* Start talking about dates where component specs get their release plans defined and submitted.  
  * Working on making [a project board](https://github.com/orgs/jakartaee/projects/17/views/1) to track Release Plan issues.  More to come in the coming week.  
* Extract Jakarta Query from Data and Persistence.  
  * Would want to have a creation / release plan created for it if it doesn’t exist already.  I know it has been brought up in the past with the specification committee, but not sure where it currently stands.  
  * Data spec is on board to use it if it does come to fruition.  
  * Proposal link:  [https://projects.eclipse.org/proposals/jakarta-query?check\_logged\_in=1](https://projects.eclipse.org/proposals/jakarta-query?check_logged_in=1).  Created by Gavin King.  
  * Need to do project inception steps.  Create a new project ballot  
  * Follow the project creation process:    
    * Process is documented [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PmhOqQGl6YfR-QHr-97QKbZcMo-L4ItQ14o3um6ix4E/edit?usp=sharing)  
  * Want to have a committer ballot from at least one person from persistence and data  
* We have discussed a Jakarta HTTP specification in the past  
  * Pulls out common HTTP requirements from the servlet / REST specifications into a common specification they both would reference  
  * Could pull out a common API for things like header and cookie functions so that there aren’t two different ways of getting headers / cookies for instance.  
  * Would need to get a proposal / release plan created for such a specification with a community of people to work on it  
  * Arjan would want to be part of the proposed group  
  * Would want to have committers from both REST and servlet communities  
  * Discussed in the Reza document for EE 12 as well.  Reza opened [https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/issues/673](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/issues/673) for this topic  
  * HTTP Request / Response general specifications for both servlet and REST  
  * RFC requirements and HTTP 1.x / 2.0 requirements common to both servlet and REST  
  * Security authentication mechanisms need to set cookies, headers and request objects and is currently only tied to servlet so cannot be used with REST and MP as easily  
  * Jakarta HTTP specification would NOT have a CDI requirement  
  * If we added HTTP 3.0 function to EE 12, would it be part of this specification?  
  * Should consider adding HTTP 3.0 function to EE 12\.  ACTION:  Jared will open an issue  
* EE12 label is used for platform repository.  Want to have component specifications use the same label to find them easily.  ACTION:  Jared will include in release plan issues and will include in email to component specs.  
* Reach out to prospective specifications to gauge interest?  
  * Jakarta Config  
    * Use **application.properties**  
      * Name used by other frameworks.  Could that cause a conflict?  
      * Ordinal choice may be important for existing applications that use this property name since it will end up changing behavior.  
      * 100 ordinal suggested to match the MP config properties file ordinal, but that could be confusing on which should win  
      * Also discussed just using microprofile-config.properties in Jakarta as well  
      * Consider a Jakarta implementation project to work out these issues  
      * Smallrye config and Helidon config are MP config implementations  
    * Continue to endorse the approach of re-packaging MicroProfile config into a jakarta spec and namespace.  
    * MP community talking about removing CDI dependency and changing properties file name as well.    
      * MP technical meeting is happening today  
      * See proposals being discussed [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1puxrGy7LlgjF4wUHH5EVHWW5W8JrsR5ImF-qg5wpXXg/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.j0c2388rgsed).  
    * Reza is bringing up this topic as well at the Steering committee  
  * Jakarta NoSQL  
    * A [1.0 release review](https://github.com/jakartaee/specifications/pull/793) has been created  
    * As per previous conversations, there is concern whether this 1.0 release is sufficient to be included into the platform due to missing things in the initial release?  Maybe would need a 1.1 or 2.0 version to be included in the platform?  
  * Jakarta MVC  
    *   
  * Jakarta RPC  
* APIs with SecurityManager / AccessController / PrivilegedAction references  
  * APIs with SecurityManager / AccessController / PrivilegedAction references ([Platform issue 1018](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/issues/1018))  
    * Activation ([issue](https://github.com/jakartaee/jaf-api/issues/125) and [PR](https://github.com/jakartaee/jaf-api/pull/169))  
    * Batch ([issue](https://github.com/jakartaee/batch/issues/215) and [PR](https://github.com/jakartaee/batch/pull/216))  
    * CDI ([issue](https://github.com/jakartaee/cdi/issues/831) and [PR](https://github.com/jakartaee/cdi/pull/830)) PR merged already  
    * JSON-P ([issue](https://github.com/jakartaee/jsonp-api/issues/403) and [PR](https://github.com/jakartaee/jsonp-api/pull/412))  
    * Mail ([issue](https://github.com/jakartaee/mail-api/issues/744) and [PR](https://github.com/jakartaee/mail-api/pull/745))  
    * Persistence ([issue](https://github.com/jakartaee/persistence/issues/666) and [PR](https://github.com/jakartaee/persistence/pull/664))  
    * REST ([issue](https://github.com/jakartaee/rest/issues/1262) and [PR](https://github.com/jakartaee/rest/pull/1295)) PR merged already  
    * Servlet ([issue](https://github.com/jakartaee/servlet/issues/789) and [PR](https://github.com/jakartaee/servlet/pull/790)) (just a javadoc update) PR merged  
    * Validation ([issue](https://github.com/jakartaee/validation/issues/242) and [PR](https://github.com/jakartaee/validation/pull/243)) (changes could be done in a service release since 3.1 was new in EE 11\)  
    * SOAP, XML Binding and XML Web Services also have references to SecurityManager artifacts and could be updated in a minor release independent of EE 12  
    * Connector has specification references that need to be cleaned up as well ([issue](https://github.com/jakartaee/connectors/issues/148))  
      * SecurityPermission annotation that may also need to be deprecated for removal.  Needs investigation  
  *

* What about releasing EE 11 Milestone 5?  
  * YESSSSSSS
