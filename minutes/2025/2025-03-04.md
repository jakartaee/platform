## Agenda

### Top of mind for Ed, Arjan, Jared

* Web Profile TCK readiness check  
  * Is this the only blocker  
    * Ed TCK review issues.  
      * [https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/issues/1769](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/issues/1769)  
      * [https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/issues/1772](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/issues/1772)  
      * [https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/issues/1773](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/issues/1773)

### TCK Refactoring Jakarta EE 11

* Signature test runner for GlassFish added  
  * Thank you Arjan for creating [https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/pull/2022](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/pull/2022)  
  * From Slack discussion [link](https://eclipsefoundationhq.slack.com/archives/C0131MLD538/p1741102228402389?thread_ts=1741101542.371289&cid=C0131MLD538)   
    * So we need issues for:  
    * **Blocker or not**: we get to decide: Static signature tests do not validate a Platform requirement.  
    * **Blocker or not**: blocker: Correct whatever causes the jakarta.security.enterprise.identitystore.openid.Scope failures.  
      * ACTION: James can take a look today.  
    * **Blocker or not**: we get to decide: Ensure the error output is processed as one single unit instead showing up in the server log but not properly returned for maven/junit test to process as single failure.  
    * Also do we need Jsp\_vehicle.jsp TCK vehicle for Web Profile?  
      * Or is it enough to only test with Servlet Vehicle?  
* CI results. Use this to give a thumbs up / thumbs down confidence level for ability to start ballot next week.

### Jakarta EE 12

* Issues have been created in the component specification repositories to create a release plan for EE 12  
  * These release plan issues are being tracked in a dashboard:  [board view](https://github.com/orgs/jakartaee/projects/17/views/1) and [table view](https://github.com/orgs/jakartaee/projects/17/views/2)  
  * Email sent to all communities about April 15 date  
  * [Jakarta EE 12 (work in progress)](https://jakartaee.github.io/platform/jakartaee12/#jakarta-ee-12-release-plan).  **ACTION:  Jared / Ed**: Add link to the board here and update dates  
  * CDI and Faces release plans are progressing well.  PRs created  
  * Config doesn’t have a release plan issue created.  There is a community for Config so can make one.  **ACTION:  Jared** will make an issue and add it to the board.  
* Java SE level discussion  
  * Current EE 12 release plan states: [https://jakartaee.github.io/platform/jakartaee12/JakartaEE12ReleasePlan](https://jakartaee.github.io/platform/jakartaee12/JakartaEE12ReleasePlan)   
    * Java SE 21 will become the minimum runtime supported by compatible implementations of Jakarta EE.  
  * Emily brought up about Java SE level minimum for component specifications  
  * If a component doesn’t have a dependency on Java SE 21 feature, should they declare Java SE 21 minimum?  
  * Java 17 support end is in the near future. (Oracle: Sept 2026 for Premier Support / September 2029 for Extended Support currently) and Jakarta EE 12 releases in 2026  
  * Some specs are still on Java SE 8 and they are doing workarounds for the module part using things like Multi-Release jars.  Those could be removed if moving up to newer minimum  
  * Requirement for Jakarta EE 12 will be for component specifications to have CCRs for Java 21 and 25 at minimum, but can do older versions  
  * If a component depends on a specification with a higher minimum Java SE level, that will not be able to run it because of its dependencies  
  * Cannot declare a minimum until we know all the dependencies’ minimums  
  * We left it up to the component specifications in the past to declare their minimums in the past, but their minimum can’t be higher than the platform minimum level  
  * Emily’s suggestion is to specify Java 17 minimum until you find out that you need it be Java 21  
  * New specifications coming in a Java 17 or 21 minimum?  
  * May need to wait for a Java SE 17 implementor to create a CCR which could delay release of a component specification  
  * If no implementor, that could be a reason to raise the minimum level
