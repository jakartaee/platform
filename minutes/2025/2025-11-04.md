## Top of mind for Jared, James

* OSSRH update  
* Platform and TCK project combination status  
  * [The EMO issue](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipsefdn/emo-team/emo/-/issues/1060) has the latest details  
  * [https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipsefdn/helpdesk/-/issues/6746](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipsefdn/helpdesk/-/issues/6746) was done on October 30 that may affect things.  
  * Lots of cleanup of where to publish things and changing of users from tck to platform based names  
  * Marlow: Please create a Sonatype support request to add groupId jakarta.tck deployment privileges to https://ci.eclipse.org/jakartaee-platform user account   
    * [https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipsefdn/helpdesk/-/issues/6827](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipsefdn/helpdesk/-/issues/6827)  
  * Scott created some issues in the tck repository to track the changes.  Focused on EE 11 changes initially, but will need to do the older and EE 12 release  
    * Marlow: Prepare for building snapshot of EE 12 Platform TCK   
      * [https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/issues/2478](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/issues/2478)  
      * Related EE 11 is [https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/issues/2475](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/issues/2475)   
  * CI jobs are now under platform instead of tck, so you will need to update your links / bookmarks  
  * May not be update EE 8 and EE 9 jobs if there is no work to happen for service releases in those.  Priority will be EE 11, EE 12 and EE 10  
* Jakarta EE 11 Retrospective  
  * The Jakarta EE Specification Committee is asking about the Jakarta EE 11 retrospective.  
  * Issue: [https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/issues/1109](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/issues/1109)  
  * Actions have not been flushed out from the retrospective yet  
  * James AI: We need to create issues in the appropriate repositories based on the linked document on the issue. Then link back the issues on the parent issue.

# Jakarta EE 12 

* \[Ivar \- Is it time to discuss the potential inclusion of Jakarta NoSQL 1.1 in Jakarta EE 12?  
  * M1 did not include any content for the new standard communication driver that has been a blocker for many people to want to vote for inclusion in the platform.  Not sure if this is the right time yet to have this vote.  
  * Otavio:  Jakarta Query has been a priority and that has been the focus to get that ready for a vote. NoSQL will have more content in M2 for Query and NoSQL integration and the communication driver.  So after M2 may be a better timeframe with this additional content  
  * Presently looking to have adapter layer to NoSQL providers.  Question arose should the implementation vendors help out with the work for the DB driver work.  
    * Oracle NoSQL have provided feedback  
    * Concern is about getting bug fixes and security fixes  
    * Example pull related to feedback:  [https://github.com/eclipse-jnosql/jnosql-databases/pull/337](https://github.com/eclipse-jnosql/jnosql-databases/pull/337)    
* M2 still being tracked for December 9 (which is in 5 weeks)  
* Marlow: Need to add a tracking Platform issue for adding the Transactions read-only description for the Platform/Web Profile specifications.  
  * Tom posted in slack:  
    Hi Jakarta Platform team. I am the Project Lead for Jakarta Transactions and I would like to draw attention to a change introduced into Jakarta Transactions intended for EE 12 which is the introduction of Read Only transactions to Jakarta Transactions. I understand this would need consideration of Jakarta Connectors team and Jakarta Messaging team to see if they would also need any changes in their specifications in order to accommodate the change. For information the Jakarta Transactions issue ([https://github.com/jakartaee/transactions/issues/220](https://github.com/jakartaee/transactions/issues/220)) and the Jakarta Transactions pull ([https://github.com/jakartaee/transactions/pull/222](https://github.com/jakartaee/transactions/pull/222)). Thank you for any feedback  
  * ACTION to create an issue on platform backlog for EE 12  
* Next week is a holiday in the US (Veterans Day).  Some people take the day off.  Sounds like we should have enough people to still have the meeting.  
* Jakarta One is coming up in 4 weeks on December 2\.  Promote, sign up, join.
