### Top of mind for Ed, Arjan, Jared

* Ed out next week.  
* Recover from Eclipse CI/CD outage  
  * Looks like the recovery is complete for platform project.  
  * Remaining component spec projects need to file issue see [JEA-526-restore](https://dev.azure.com/jakarta-ee-azdo/jakarta-ee-azdo/_workitems/edit/526).  
    * [https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipsefdn/helpdesk/-/issues/new](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipsefdn/helpdesk/-/issues/new)   
    * For example, EclipseLink and Jersey.  
    * Status of CI workspaces can be found here: [https://ci.eclipse.org/](https://ci.eclipse.org/)   
  * Concurrency: [https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipsefdn/helpdesk/-/issues/6109](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipsefdn/helpdesk/-/issues/6109)  
  * Data: [https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipsefdn/helpdesk/-/issues/6110](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipsefdn/helpdesk/-/issues/6110) 

### Jakarta EE 11

* **Tentative** schedule thoughts  
  * May 21 TCK complete  
  * June 5 CCR created and mentor review started  
  * June 9 start ballot (complete 7 to 14 days)  
* TCK  
  * 10 remaining failures  
    * Have been excluded.  
    * Functionality is covered in other tests. The failures are all in the appclient vehicle for the set of functionality covered in other vehicles. And we have plenty of app client coverage in other persistence tests.  
  * Signature testing  
    * Working  
      * AppClient  
      * Servlet/JSP  
    * Not yet working  
      * BLOCKER for 21 May date: Data  
        * We have a TCK runner for running the Data TCK.  
        * [https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/issues/2260](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/issues/2260) (also see [https://www.eclipse.org/lists/glassfish-dev/msg01618.html](https://www.eclipse.org/lists/glassfish-dev/msg01618.html))  
        * Approaches  
          * Do it in the runner  
          * Do it by adding the API jar to the POM in GlassFish  
            * Release milestone of GlassFish  
        * ACTION: Arjan to double-check that CI for GlassFish has been restored.  
  * Non-GlassFish implementations  
    * WildFly  
      * Some duplication of tests that need to be mitigated  
        * James Perkins: So far JPA is the only issue I've had. I've got EJB, Pages and a few others working.  
      * James continues to work on it, but further along than in previous EE releases.  
    * Liberty  
      * Working toward 11 Web Profile passing.  
* Update Jakarta EE Tutorial for 11 [JEA-532](https://dev.azure.com/jakarta-ee-azdo/jakarta-ee-azdo/_workitems/edit/532)  
  * Kito has taken the lead on this, Ed to sync up with him.  
  * Everything that’s new in 11  
  * Everything that’s new in 10

### Jakarta EE 12

* Plan review ballot status [https://github.com/orgs/jakartaee/projects/17](https://github.com/orgs/jakartaee/projects/17)   
* Review where components specs are on the board  
  * Still waiting on 1 component to go to ballot  
    * Activation (Lukas): Jorge Bescos Gascon provided the plan for EE 12  
* Jakarta HTTP  
  * Mailing list communication to platform, rest and servlet hasn’t happened yet.  
    * Arjan still working on this. There was productive feedback in the google doc. [https://docs.google.com/document/d/12niPzZdISs7hRdTWsZn\_JM30Et9kWuih4F8h87LKHI4/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12niPzZdISs7hRdTWsZn_JM30Et9kWuih4F8h87LKHI4/edit?usp=sharing)  
* MicroProfile moving to Jakarta update  
  * Regarding straw poll for namespace: [https://www.eclipse.org/lists/microprofile-wg/msg02751.html](https://www.eclipse.org/lists/microprofile-wg/msg02751.html)  
    * Subjective analysis: Current status seems to favor “2) Change the namespace to jakarta.\*”  
    * Open discussion about straw poll wording and how it relates to the namespace “red line”.  
  * [https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r/week/2025/1/21](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r/week/2025/1/21) is today’s MP community call 3 hours after this one started
