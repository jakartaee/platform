## Top of mind for Jared, James

* Emily: Retaining MP namespace ballot forthcoming (following the discussion [here](https://www.eclipse.org/lists/jakartaee-platform-dev/msg04832.html))  
* New Agentic AI specification project created:  
  * [https://jakarta.ee/specifications/agentic-ai/](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/agentic-ai/)  
  * No repo, mailing list or project page created yet.  In progress.  
  * Expect to be stand-alone for now until it is more flushed out for maybe EE 13 or 14\.  
  * May have a Jakarta Futures call in January about this new spec  
* [3 new CCRs](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3Acertification) for platform exist.  One is from yesterday and the other 2 will be 2 weeks on Friday.

# Jakarta EE 12 

* Still aiming for Dec 9 for M2 completion before the end of year holidays  
* Read-only Transaction new function.  
  * Read-only Transactions needs to be added to Platform Spec for EE 12\.    
    * [https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/issues/1201](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/issues/1201) is the tracker  
    * Mostly notably will cover JDBC and other spec integration with that function  
  * Messaging mailing list discussion is also happening for Transaction Read-only function  
  * Will need TCK testing to show that the transaction is marked read only before doing work  
  * Concern that there is the possibility that updates will be lost without knowing it.  
    * Similar things can happen with persistence with context not being added to the transaction  
    * Nathan has suggested some options to tweak the design.  Being discussed in the connector spec   
    * Need to have this well documented and/or force failures when modifications are happening in a read only transaction context  
  * Also there are design discussions about not extending XAResource, but instead to have a mix-in interface instead  
* [https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/issues/2478](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/issues/2478) EE 12 prepare for snapshot release.  
  * Mostly need to cherry-pick or sync up [EE 11 Platform TCK changes](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/issues/2475) to EE 12  
* Jakarta Futures on Thursday this week **may** cover Jakarta Portlet new specs
