## Top of mind for Ed, Arjan, Jared

* OSSRH  
  * IT is taking the actions right now. It might be a while before they get around to Krazo, but Ivar will attend to it when they do.  
* EE 11 ballot started 2025-06-09  
  * Voting goes through 2025-06-24, but please vote as soon as you can.  
* Select date to use a platform call to perform an EE 11 retrospective.  
  * Here is the one we created for EE 10\. [https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/issues/560](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/issues/560)   
  * I have created one for EE 11 [https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/issues/1109](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/issues/1109) .  
    * Collecting retrospective content at this [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XVmpPjsXG6EHF05IndOAVY50cGhNzO0VYXxHvz1csrg/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.2atztmyfivz3).  
  * Confirmed date: Next week 2025-06-24.  
  * ACTION: Ed to send email to platform list.

## Jakarta EE 11

* EE 11 end game  
  * Merge [GF PR 25543](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/glassfish/pull/25543).  
  * Ivar has asserted that [https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/issues/1107](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/issues/1107) is ready to go once the preceding PR has been merged.  
  * Ivar started the ballot to approve [https://github.com/jakartaee/specifications/pull/849](https://github.com/jakartaee/specifications/pull/849) .  
* Planning to have Platform TCK retrospective on June 18 TCK call

## Jakarta EE 12

* Review administrative issues  
  * Request spec projects to take a simple action to make their specs more discoverable by search engines and AI. See [https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/issues/1108](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/issues/1108) .    
    * [https://github.com/jakartaee/mvc/pull/115/files](https://github.com/jakartaee/mvc/pull/115/files) is an example  
  * TCK: separate web and platform profiles. [https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/issues/2367](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/issues/2367)   
    * Looking for the simplest solution. Above all, don’t make this a blocker for EE 12\.  
    * May be possible by simply publishing two different User Guides. Use the “include” feature to make this possible.  
* Tech Talks are happening and can be done by others  
  * Tech Talk about Jakarta EE 11 generally by Ed and Arjan on June 25  
  * Michael Redlich going to do a [Getting Started with Jakarta EE 11 and What’s New in Jakarta EE 12](https://sessionize.com/s/michael-redlich/getting-started-with-jakarta-ee-11-and-whats-new-i/136810) talk as well June 25  
* Newsletter article that Ed referenced:  [https://newsroom.eclipse.org/eclipse-newsletter/2025/may/jakarta-ee-12-ready-hit-ground-running](https://newsroom.eclipse.org/eclipse-newsletter/2025/may/jakarta-ee-12-ready-hit-ground-running)  
* MP and Jakarta update  
  * 4 straw polls were ongoing.  3 ended and 1 ends today.  
  * Mostly positive responses to the polls, but a few negative votes.  
  * Namespace rename to jakarta is the most contentious  
    * Likely would be good to have the change over  
    * Exceptions would be deprecated specs like mpOpenTracing and mpMetrics  
    * MP Telemetry has its own namespace and doesn’t have separate MP API  
    * Will need to be able to do service releases of previous versions still have course for those versions before the “big bang” change  
    * Eclipse Transformer will be helpful for customers and vendors to be able to make this transition just like the javax to jakarta transformation  
  * MP JWT may fold into Jakarta Security.  May not need JWT Bridge necessarily after the MP to Jakarta transition
