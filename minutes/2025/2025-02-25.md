## Agenda

### Top of mind for Ed, Arjan, Jared

* Ed TCK review issues.  
  * [https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/issues/1769](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/issues/1769)  
  * [https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/issues/1772](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/issues/1772)  
  * [https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/issues/1773](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/issues/1773)  
* Thanks to Scott Stark for releasing the 10 staged jars at the request of the MicroProfile community.

### TCK Refactoring Jakarta EE 11

* Get status to report to Steering Committee for Web Profile release.  
  * Arjan observed that the voting must start no later than 12 March.  
    * There are many moving parts. It will be a challenge to get it all done so we can hit our end of Q1 target.  
    * Need responsiveness on the part of the mentors to rapidly iterate any issues that arise.  
      * Ivar is the mentor, so we are in good shape for responsiveness.  
  * Scott Marlow observed  
    * We’ll have compatibility results for the GlassFish build.  
    * Once we’ve approved that acceptable, we don’t create an extra CCR, but we always do another validation against another implementation. This double check is important. We don’t want to skip that.  
  * What about the signature tests?  
    * Do we need a job for this?  
      * Yes, we do not have one yet.  
    * Are they all in a running state?  
      * More changes are [needed](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/issues/1985).  
    * We need a TCK runner for the signature tests for GlassFish.  
    * Scott Marlow’s approach  
      * Do a Jenkins job of the release  
      * Run the signature tests against the result of that build.  
    * Arjan asked what about the component TCKs? They have their own signature tests. When we run the overall signature tests, does it differ?  
      * Yes, spec TCKs do not have to deploy against EE containers but platform TCK does.  
      * Discuss at 2025-02-26 TCK call.  
* **These jobs are breaking**. Please be mindful when making changes to look at jobs:

### Jakarta EE 12

* Issues have been created in the component specification repositories to create a release plan for EE 12  
  * These release plan issues are being tracked in a dashboard:  [board view](https://github.com/orgs/jakartaee/projects/17/views/1) and [table view](https://github.com/orgs/jakartaee/projects/17/views/2)  
  * Need to come up with a date for when we want to have release plans created  
    * April 15  
    * Current planned release of EE 12 is 1H 2026 for reference  
    * ACTION:  Jared \- Send email to the mailing list of each component specification with link to their issue and the board and the deadline  
  * [Jakarta EE 12 (work in progress)](https://jakartaee.github.io/platform/jakartaee12/#jakarta-ee-12-release-plan).  Add link to the board here and update dates  
* Jakarta HTTP  
  * If we plan to create a new Jakarta HTTP specification for HTTP requirements and unified API for HTTP based technologies, we need to do a creation review as documented [specification process](https://jakarta.ee/committees/specification/guide/#creation) and [this google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PmhOqQGl6YfR-QHr-97QKbZcMo-L4ItQ14o3um6ix4E/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.qiqurtgvrrco).  
  * ACTION:  Arjan to start the process to do a proposal / creation review process  
    * Arjan start proposal (google doc?) and then socialize in the REST / Servlet mailing list at minimum.    
    * Need to get community buy in and getting people to participate with Arjan on the proposal  
  * HTTP request / response interfaces inspired by Servlet and REST APIs  
    * Cookie, headers  
  * Include RFCs that are associated with HTTP like with how cookies are handled  
  * Need to include people from REST and Servlet communities  
    * Tomcat, Jersey, Wildfly developers  
  * Include HTTP 1, 2 and 3 as part of this specification to be determined  
  * Java SE includes some features for HTTP that may be relevant here.  Will want to include Java SE APIs that are relevant to EE APIs  
  * Would the REST / Servlet communities resist this specification?  
    * REST doesn’t depend on servlet, but can optionally inject servlet.  With this spec wouldn’t need to have this optional requirement.  REST would just do the new HTTP request / response  
  * Faces and Pages may also get references to request / response as well.  So will want people from those communities as well.  
* Jakarta Config  
  * Lots of good discussion on the mailing lists which has been helpful  
* Jakarta Query  
  * Gavin King created proposal  
  * Proposal is missing some information that is needed before can move on  
  * [https://github.com/jakartaee/specifications/issues/777](https://github.com/jakartaee/specifications/issues/777)  
  * Community review needs to be started  
  * NoSQL also uses Query
