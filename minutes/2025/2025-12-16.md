## Top of mind for Jared, James

* OSSRH no real update at this point as Ivar was traveling  
  * James might try the [https://github.com/eclipse-cbi/central-staging-plugins?tab=readme-ov-file\#complete-workflow-with-profile](https://github.com/eclipse-cbi/central-staging-plugins?tab=readme-ov-file#complete-workflow-with-profile) change on the REST repository  
  * Ivar has asked Infra to add the secret token to the following projects to start testing with real projects:  
    * [https://ci.eclipse.org/data](https://ci.eclipse.org/data)  
    * [https://ci.eclipse.org/rest](https://ci.eclipse.org/rest)  
    * [https://ci.eclipse.org/krazo](https://ci.eclipse.org/krazo)  
    * [https://ci.eclipse.org/nosql](https://ci.eclipse.org/nosql)  
    * [https://ci.eclipse.org/mvc](https://ci.eclipse.org/mvc)  
    * [https://ci.eclipse.org/jnosql](https://ci.eclipse.org/jnosql) (Note\! this one is under the Technology PMC)  
  * Issue to follow: [https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipsefdn/helpdesk/-/issues/6890\#note\_5570832](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipsefdn/helpdesk/-/issues/6890#note_5570832)   
    * To get notified about updates to the issue, go to the menu on the top right and select to have notification enabled  
  * Ivar will also request mojarra and faces to be added to the list of projects to be updated with the secret token  
* December meeting schedule  
  * Canceled Dec 23 and 30 meetings.  Will be back on January 6

# Jakarta EE 12

* \[Jan\] MP WG merge into Jakarta WG status update  
  * At the last MP Steering Committee call, the merge was discussed  
  * IBM doesn’t want to push it any more from the MP side due to the failure of the ballot  
  * Majority from the ballot seems to indicate a desire to do the namespace change  
  * Jan will take the torch moving forward  
  * Convert MP Config to Jakarta Config for use for Jakarta EE 12  
  * Entire MP WG to Jakarta WG is also an option to continue to discuss  
  * MP WG changes recently may have an impact with some people leaving it and Red Hat now being part of IBM  
  * Namespace discussion involves both updating the package name and the maven coordinates  
  * The debate still is how a namespace impacts existing users vs new users seeing a fractured namespace in Jakarta  
* Does anyone have any M2 updates for their specifications?  
  * Otávio: We moved it to January, right? [https://www.agilejava.eu/2025/12/15/hashtag-jakarta-ee-311/](https://www.agilejava.eu/2025/12/15/hashtag-jakarta-ee-311/)  
    * Yes January 27 is the new M2 date  
    * We can release this year, those spec, but it would be amazing having this extra time to close some details.  
  * Persistence is getting a lot of updates done with reviews happening  
    * Many EclipseLink committers are no longer with Oracle and it may have an impact on that implementation.  This could impact Jakarta EE 12 implementation  
    * Ideally persistence would have two implementations  
  * Concurrency implementation Concurrō is getting updated for new features in the new version – Lock for instance  
  * Security want to have something for M2  
  * Faces 5.0 wants to have something for M2 as well.  Lots of changes are already done for it.  Will include Mojarra as well.  MyFaces also has updates.  API is now in the Faces project instead of Mojarra.  Ideally will be usable by both Mojarra and MyFaces, but TBD  
* NoSQL 1.1 current status  
  * Is the driver still planned for inclusion in 1.1?  
    * Still in consideration  
  * Otavio \- we got some delays on TCK on Jakarta Query to both: Jakarta Data, Jakarta Query and Jakarta Persistence. Not sure yet. The priority is still on releasing Jakarta Query.  
  * Otavio: The Jakarta NoSQL requires Configuration (i.e. Jakarta Config), once it involves configuration, it would be amazing having Configuration as well.  
  * Jakarta Config not being there is impactful due to different config models for different NoSQL providers  
  * May need to set a date when we need to have Config there in order to give specs who depend on it to consume it
