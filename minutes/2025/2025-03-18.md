### Jakarta EE 12

* Considerations for EE 12 for TCK updates  
  * JSON and Persistence tests do not run in a container.  Would be good to include container tests as well as part of the TCK in vNext of those specs.  Previously discussed by Emily and Dmitry  
    * Persistence tests currently are duplicated in the platform-tck to run them in a container so didn’t change the released TCK for persistence  
    * Persistence TCK tests currently are in the platform-tck repository and would be good to move it over to persistence repository  
      * [https://github.com/jakartaee/persistence/issues/702](https://github.com/jakartaee/persistence/issues/702)  
    * Possible idea is to use a protocol for Java SE vs container scenarios  
    * TCK requirements for both Java SE and EE tests are documented in the process:  [https://jakarta.ee/committees/specification/tckprocess/](https://jakarta.ee/committees/specification/tckprocess/)  
    * ACTION:  Create issue for JSON and Persistence repositories to include container tests  
  * Some TCKs still are using the old JavaTest test framework in EE 11 and that transformation should continue in EE 12  
  * Additional component TCKs are still hosted in platform-tck repository and would be good to move over to their repositories.   
    * Tags, EJB, Connectors are ones we were able to identify on the call  
  * CDI TCK has both Java SE and container mode tests in them that can be used as an example  
    * EE integration tests were moved to platform-tck repo in EE 11, but could still be hosted in CDI and have them in another folder and archive  
* Jakarta HTTP  
  * Arjan working on proposal draft  
  * Will have a google doc to share shortly, but not today yet.  Aiming for by next meeting  
  * Concept can be broad, so need to set the scope appropriately  
    * Request / response object  
    * Header / cookie handling  
  * HTTP client concept is being brought up as an idea.  Want to avoid feature creep though depending on other people’s thoughts  
    * Cookie / header handling  
    * Pooling / connection caching  
    * Framework to add things like security integration  
    * REST client possibly being able to extend such an API  
      * Currently doesn’t have easy security integration  
* [https://github.com/orgs/jakartaee/projects/17/](https://github.com/orgs/jakartaee/projects/17/) project board for EE 12 release plans  
  * Faces 5.0 should be able to move to mentor review shortly to go to ballot  
  * Concurrency 3.2 is getting close to being ready to make a release plan review PR in the next few weeks
