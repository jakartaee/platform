### Top of mind for Ed, Arjan, Jared

* OSSRH \-\> Central Publishing Portal  
  * [Issue](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/ee4j/issues/98) created for updating the Parent POM  
  * Migration Timeline (copied from [email](https://www.eclipse.org/lists/cross-project-issues-dev/msg20056.html) to cross-projects-issues mailing list):  
    * **Now → May 30**: Feedback window – projects may opt out of the June 9 migration and be part of the second phase on June 24 Comment on the migration ticket with a \+1 from PL: [OSSRH end-of-life on June 30th, 2025](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipsefdn/helpdesk/-/issues/5854)  
    * **June 9**: First migration batch – all projects (except those that choose to opt out) will be moved to [**`central.sonatype.org`](http://central.sonatype.org/)**  
    * **June 24**: Final migration batch – for all **remaining** projects  
    * **July 1–4**: Cleanup – OSSRH secrets removed, legacy accounts deactivated, and obsolete configs cleaned up  
* Job to be done  
  * For each POM that publishes to the existing OSSRH, find the \<pluginManagement\> element and make it so it contains the \<artifactId\>central-publishing-maven-plugin\</artifactId\> as described in [https://central.sonatype.org/publish/publish-portal-maven/](https://central.sonatype.org/publish/publish-portal-maven/) . [https://central.sonatype.org/faq/what-is-different-between-central-portal-and-legacy-ossrh/\#publishing](https://central.sonatype.org/faq/what-is-different-between-central-portal-and-legacy-ossrh/#publishing)   
  * Eclipse IT will handle the settings.xml work.  
* Ivar to do the proof-of-concept work at [https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/issues/1104](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/issues/1104) 

### Jakarta EE 11

* **Tentative** schedule thoughts  
  * May 21 TCK complete ❌  
    * TCK call tomorrow we will re-evaluate the completeness and hopefully draw a line to get this done. We are at the enough is enough stage.  
    * We do have a staged final TCK. There is a green build.  
  * June 5 CCR to be created and mentor review to start..  
  * June 9 to start ballot (complete 7 to 14 days)  
* Data API added to Glassfish will be done shortly and a new release created ✅  
  * Plan to work on this with the other two bugs opened up for what are perceived regressions to be resolved and included in a new release. ✅  
* Seeing many tests still failing.  May be more things to work out.  
  * Assembly  
  * EJB tests  
  * Mail TCK  
  * Signature (Requires Data API update) ✅

### Jakarta EE 12

* Plan review ballot status [https://github.com/orgs/jakartaee/projects/17](https://github.com/orgs/jakartaee/projects/17)   
  * All ballots are complete  
* MicroProfile moving to Jakarta update  
  * 2 \+1, 2 \-1 and 1 abstain from the straw poll discussed last week.  Inconclusive.  
  * Working on ballot verbage  
  * Discussing continues at today MP technical community call  
* Milestone planning  
  * Wave plan needs to be created  
  * “Milestone 0” ideas  
    * OSSRH updates that are needed  
    * Service release branch existing for previous in GH  
    * New / main branch up-to-date with service release updates from previous version  
    * Jenkins job created for the new version with a **staged snapshot** version for API, Javadoc, spec and TCK likely with previous version content at least  
    * Make sure service stream Jenkins jobs are working  
    * If not done, move from master branch to main  
* BOM earlier in the milestones  
  * Platform spec would include an update with the EE 11 versions and when there are Milestone releases of the component specs to update BOM as part of the platform Milestone release.  Similar to what we did in EE 11\.  
* JNDI deprecation possibly in the platform / component specs with EE 12?  
  * Deprecation with replacement being CDI enablement  
  * Spec investigation in early milestones  
  * ACTION:  create an issue in the platform repository  
  * Some discussions in component specs  
  * Need to look at @Resource JNDI ties and how JNDI deprecation will affect it.   
  * Some things with @Resource do not have ties to JNDI and we would need some function that replaces it.    
  * @Inject could be used, but will need to have appropriate qualifiers like what was done with EntityManager or some other new function.   
  * Connectors spec would need these updates since @Resource is highly used in that spec and needs additional function to handle the additional configs provided with @Resource  
  * There are other resources injected like with @EJB and @WebServiceRef  
  * Consider for future deprecation of EJB but probably not in EE 12  
  * XML WS could make a service release to use @Inject instead of @WebServiceRef, but not likely a priority for the now stand-alone spec  
* Administrative issues board [https://github.com/orgs/jakartaee/projects/18](https://github.com/orgs/jakartaee/projects/18)   
  * [Specification-committee \#74](https://github.com/jakartaee/specification-committee/issues/74)
