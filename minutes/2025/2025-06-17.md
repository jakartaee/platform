## Top of mind for Ed, Arjan, Jared

* EE 11 Platform passed the ballot less than 12 hours ago.  
* Re-order the order of business in this meeting.  
  * EE 12 first.  
  * Maintenance release related issues after.  
* Working Group session today at Steering Committee time slot

## Jakarta EE 12

* MP and Jakarta update  
  * JESP discussion at the Jakarta specification committee meeting and subsequent ballot about jakarta namespace requirement update has caused some concern  
  * Still no MP WG ballot timeline  
  * Concern expressed about governance openness difference between MP and Jakarta – Specification and Steering committee meetings  
    * Jakarta WG charter defines the governance model  
    * Jakarta tech meetings are open  
    * Jakarta governance committee meetings in the past were not attended beyond the required members when they were more open and there was some zoom bombing which should be addressed now  
    * Can be changed if desired  
  * If all of MP doesn’t come over to Jakarta, fallback solution would be to just bring over MP Config.  This can become a testing ground for the rest of MP.  
  * Would be good to possibly bring in MP JWT into Security and MP Rest Client into Restful Web Services specs  
* Tanja brought up discussion about what is Jakarta doing about AI  
  * Hearing questions from people in the industry / social media in response to things like Spring AI  
  * This topic also comes up and is discussed during the Jakarta Futures Interest meetings happening every other week  
  * MicroProfile AI using langchain4j with CDI exists out there  
  * With merge of MP into Jakarta, it would become part of Jakarta as well  
  * With AI / LLM offerings changing their APIs frequently, it didn’t make sense to have our own Jakarta specification until things become more stable with a langchain4j implementation  
  * An API provided by Jakarta would be a client API, not a server API  
  * MP API doesn’t provide an agentic AI offering yet  
  * Could consider having an expert within the Jakarta community to work on / discuss AI  
    * Attending Jakarta Futures and MP AI should be done by people who are interested  
  * There are multiple implementations out there, but may not be mature enough and changing so much to standardize. Would need to pick one to prototype on  
  * Would be good for us to discuss this with a statement / blog about our direction based off of watching what is happening and considering a future direction when things stabilize more  
    * ACTION: Ed Burns to create a gist that answers the question, “What is Open Standard Enterprise Java’s answer to AI?”. This gist will be iterated and its content published on [https://jakarta.ee/blogs/](https://jakarta.ee/blogs/) .
