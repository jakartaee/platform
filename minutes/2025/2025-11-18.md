## Top of mind for Jared, James

* [3 new CCRs](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3Acertification).  Some concerns.    
  * LG isn’t part of the Jakarta EE WG  
    * [https://jakarta.ee/compatibility/get-listed/](https://jakarta.ee/compatibility/get-listed/)  
    * [https://jakarta.ee/membership/members/](https://jakarta.ee/membership/members/)  
    * They can do a CCR, but will not be listed as compatible and will not be able to use the Jakarta logo  
    * Tanya reached out to LG about possibly joining the WG  
  * Checkboxes are not checked for the TongWeb ones to say that “attest that all TCK requirements have been met”.  They opened over 2 weeks ago.  
    * Will update the CCRs to get the CCR completed with all the check boxes  
* Next week’s meeting.  Have it still?  Holiday week in the US.  
  * Will still have the meeting since most people appear to be available

# Jakarta EE 12 

* Follow-up with Emily if there about what was discussed at Spec Committee for MP  
  * Emily started a poll with the specification committee [here](https://www.eclipse.org/lists/jakarta.ee-spec/msg04220.html) as suggested by the Jakarta EE spec committee call last week.  
  * Concerns were discussed that it states that MP “must” remain with its namespace  
  * Should it be “may” to allow each spec to choose to change in the future?  
  * Does it require if MP specs move to Jakarta specs, like MP REST Client moving to Jakarta RESTful Web Services, does Jakarta REST need to still use the API as is from MP or can it be assimilated into the existing Jakarta REST API structure with the jakarta namespace?  
* Still aiming for Dec 9 for M2 completion before the end of year holidays  
  * James: REST hasn’t been doing much for M1 or M2.  
  * Nathan: Data has been working on some API changes and updated some new TCK tests.  Not enough yet to warrant a M2 release in their opinion.  
  * Persistence has a backlog of PRs to be reviewed and merged.  
    * New committer ballots are started to help alleviate the backlog  
* EE 12 TCK updates  
  * TCK call is tomorrow.  Please join  
  * [https://ci.eclipse.org/jakartaee-platform/job/JakartaEE-TCK/job/12/job/stage-release-artifacts/job/TCKDistRelease/](https://ci.eclipse.org/jakartaee-platform/job/JakartaEE-TCK/job/12/job/stage-release-artifacts/job/TCKDistRelease/) is almost working with the sonatype changes \+ TCK CI move to the Platform…  
  * Finishing up syncing up changes from EE 11 to the EE 12 branch  
* Platform / TCK combination status  
  * The platform and tck projects both still exist.  The committer lists haven’t been combined yet it appears.  [Scott added issue comment](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipsefdn/emo-team/emo/-/issues/1060#note_5327055).  
* Open floor  
  * JakartaOne is December 2
