## Top of mind for Jared, James

* OSSRH status  
  * Plugin created:  
    * [https://github.com/eclipse-cbi/central-staging-plugins](https://github.com/eclipse-cbi/central-staging-plugins)   
  * Need to get added to the parent POM  
  * People would use the new parent POM version or if not used update to use the new plugin  
  * Question came up where is staging location for the new central   
  * Data will look at trying it out, but would possibly need the new parent POM update   
    * Did not happen last week

## Jakarta EE 12

* Milestone 1 is roughed into a schedule for completing in September  
  * From previous meeting these were the outlined tasks to be completed in M1 at a minimum  
    * OSSRH updates  
    * Service release branch created for N-1 release  
    * New / main branch up-to-date with service release updates from previous version  
    * Version update to the new version number including updating Export and Import versions in API jar’s [MANIFEST.MF](http://MANIFEST.MF) and Specification document  
    * TCK moved from platform repo if appropriate  
    * Remove all tests from exclude list  
    * TCK running with EE 11 ratifying implementation (tests could be failing due to new tests added / excluded tests no longer removed)  
    * Jenkins job created for the new version for API, Javadoc, spec and TCK  
    * Make sure service stream Jenkins jobs are working for API and TCK  
    * If not done, move from master branch to main?  
      * May change to not do this.  Will follow up on requirement / suggestion to make that change  
      * It isn’t about politics.  It is about being consistent across the different Jakarta repos  
    * Updates for the SOE change in the specification document  
* MP and Jakarta  
  * MP community has just finished their break.  Call is later today  
  * David’s mailing list thread was discussed at call last week and will happen again today likely  
  * If a complete move of MP to Jakarta WG is going to be delay, we need to discuss if we can move MP Config sooner than later.  The concern is that it touches all of MP as well and has a ripple effect.  
* Platform and TCK merge ballot to be started in September as previously discussed.  
  * Ballot to be created in the next week likely  
  * No negative feedback as of yet so don’t expect an issues with the ballot  
* Glassfish being used normally as the ratifying implementation for Web Profile / Platform delayed things for EE 11  
  * Glassfish is not funded by Jakarta and there are little resources available for that team  
  * May want to consider if we can find another implementation for EE 12 to be first and not assume it will be Glassfish  
  * Open Liberty and Wildfly were used for Core Profile for EE 11, not Glassfish  
  * We removed tests that were failing for EE 11 with Glassfish and they will be re-enabled in EE 12 and will need to determine what needs to be fixed.  Kicked the can down the road.
