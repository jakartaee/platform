## Agenda

### Top of mind for Ed, Arjan, Jared

* “GlassFish 8.0 JDK17” branch running on 17 passes all the EE 11 Web Profile TCK.  
  * We have one ratifying compatible implementation.  
  * Need CCR  
* “GlassFish 8.0 running on 21” running on 21 passes all the EE 11 Web Profile TCK  
  * Need CCR  
* Additional EE 11 implementations  
  * Open Liberty: not in a position to try to pass Web Profile TCK  
  * WildFly: not in a position to try to pass Web Profile TCK  
* Readiness review for EE 11 Web Profile release  
  * Release review PR [https://github.com/jakartaee/specifications/pull/802](https://github.com/jakartaee/specifications/pull/802)   
    * Need help with some checkboxes.  
  * ACTION: API staging needs to be done again.  Missing Core Profile classes in the javadoc.   [https://ci.eclipse.org/jakartaee-platform/job/1\_jakartaee-api-stage/14/](https://ci.eclipse.org/jakartaee-platform/job/1_jakartaee-api-stage/14/)

    * Either update the CI job to build core profile as well as web profile  
    * Or list each component spec in the web profile pom.xml to not require core profile to be built before web profile API using [this PR](https://github.com/jakartaee/jakartaee-api/pull/192)  
  * Platform TCK must stage  
    * Do we need to stage a final now for the ballot?  
      * Yes, we need to stage a final  
  * CCR for Java 17 and Java 21 for GlassFish  
    * [https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/glassfish/main/distributions/web/8.0.0-M10/web-8.0.0-M10.zip](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/glassfish/main/distributions/web/8.0.0-M10/web-8.0.0-M10.zip) for Java 21 \+ [https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/glassfish/main/distributions/web/8.0.0-JDK17-M10/web-8.0.0-JDK17-M10.zip](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/glassfish/main/distributions/web/8.0.0-JDK17-M10/web-8.0.0-JDK17-M10.zip) for Java 17
