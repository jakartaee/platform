## Agenda

### Top of mind for Ed, Arjan, Jared

* Spec-committee-55 implementation  
  * Great news\! Many thanks to @starksm64 for making it so the TCK jars are staged, as required by this issue:  
  * [https://jakarta.oss.sonatype.org/content/groups/staging/jakarta/tck/](https://jakarta.oss.sonatype.org/content/groups/staging/jakarta/tck/)  is the root groupId of the staged artifact  
  * Emily was asking, “what about 10?” Is it possible to get these out there?  
    * Scott Stark stated we would need a service release of the Jakarta EE 10 Core profile TCK. This additional requirement will not negatively impact Scott Stark’s existing EE 11 TCK progress.  
* Jakarta-tck-1867:  
  * ACTION: reassigned this to Ed to just put the unified LICENSE.md   
  * Ed TCK review issues.  
    * [https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/issues/1769](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/issues/1769)  
    * [https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/issues/1772](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/issues/1772)  
    * [https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/issues/1773](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/issues/1773)

### TCK Refactoring Jakarta EE 11

* 

### Jakarta EE 12

* [Issues labeled for Jakarta EE 12](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3AEE12)  
* Config  
  * MP tech call did meet last week  
    * MP community thinks it is better for Jakarta to use MP config directly instead of copying it to the different namespace.  
    * Two options discussed from [Emily’s document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1puxrGy7LlgjF4wUHH5EVHWW5W8JrsR5ImF-qg5wpXXg/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.j0c2388rgsed)  
    * MP Config has reference to MP parent which references Core Profile causing circular dependency if we add MP Config reference from Core Profile  
    * MP Config split into two parts – Core and CDI part  
      * No matter what we think this should happen regardless  
    * Would be nice to have a MP Config that didn’t depend on any other specifications  
      * MP Config depend on MP Config Core which doesn’t depend on anything, but MP Config still has dependency on MP / CDI as an example approach  
      * Discussed having a profile in MicroProfile that could be used by Jakarta  MP depends on MP Core Profile, but MP Core Profile doesn’t depend on Jakarta APIs and Jakarta can also depend on MP Core Profile    
        * MP depends on MP Core & Jakarta Core   
        * Jakarta Core depends on MP Core  
      * May not need a Profile yet since only MP Config core right now  
      * Concerns about release cadence differences between Jakarta and MP communities  
    * MP TCKs do not include a signature test.  
      * Platform / Profile TCK would have a signature  
      * Question on whether we would want something similar for MP config to exist if MP config is added to the Jakarta Platform  
      * Jakarta EE TCK process is documented [here](https://jakarta.ee/committees/specification/tckprocess/)  
      * Question discussed on whether signature is required by Jakarta TCKs or just a convention?  
  * Can we define the configuration names in the Jakarta specifications and then when MP config is available with Jakarta they are used?  
    * How would this be tested in a TCK?  
  * Discussed copyright concerns, Jakarta and MP use EPL Copyrights  
  *
