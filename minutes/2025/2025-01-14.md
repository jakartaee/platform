## Agenda

### Top of mind for Ed, Arjan, Jared

* \[Ed\] Jared will run next week’s meeting.  
* \[Ivar\] Reminder to review certification requests  
  * It is our collective responsibility to review these as they come in  
  * Check the issue tracker for issues labeled [**certification**](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Acertification).  
    * Check out this how-to guide for reviewing CCRs, authored by Ed Bratt with a little help from Ed Burns: [https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/wiki/Compatibility\_Certification\_Request\_CCR\_Review\_Guidance](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/wiki/Compatibility_Certification_Request_CCR_Review_Guidance)   
* \[Jared\] Seeking review on [https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/pull/1017](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/pull/1017) 

### TCK Refactoring Jakarta EE 11

* Web Profile TCK status  
  * Tests well in hand.  
    * Persistence  
      * Tests run: 3818, Failures: 0, Errors: 9, Skipped: 0  
    * Marlow: EAR producing tests with \`@Tag("web")\` need to switch to produce WAR instead as per [https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/issues/1738](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/issues/1738)  
      * [https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/pull/1748](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/pull/1748) is an example of a change to address ^  
  * [https://ci.eclipse.org/jakartaee-tck/view/EFTL-Certification-Jobs-11/job/11/job/standalone-tck/job/eftl-jakartaeetck-run-web/](https://ci.eclipse.org/jakartaee-tck/view/EFTL-Certification-Jobs-11/job/11/job/standalone-tck/job/eftl-jakartaeetck-run-web/)  
    * Need more clarity on which of the sub-jobs from the above are “all good” vs. “needs more work”.  
    * All good means: the job is running as intended for ratifying the Jakarta EE 11 Web Profile.  
    * Needs more work means:   
      * either the TCK needs to be replaced with the TCK that runs inside the container.  
      * **Or**  
      * Additional tests need to be run, on top of what is in the job. These tests live in the Platform TCK.  
    * ACTION: This needs to be documented in the TCK User Guide.  
      * For 10  
        * JSONB and JSONP  
        * Mail  
  * Low likelihood of unknown unknowns arising.  
    * Oops: the [https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/issues/1738](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/issues/1738) is an example of this.  
  * Plan to pivot to writing TCK User Guide this week.  
  * **Next week I plan to ask for an estimate for when Web Profile TCK will be ready to ask the spec committee to merge the PR.**  
* Platform Profile TCK status  
  * \~6,500 persistence tests still blocked by App Client \-\> remote EJB \-\> test invocation mechanism.  
    * Proposal to rewrite those to use App Client \-\> Servlet \-\> test invocation mechanism.  
    * Note: we still have other app client test that validate that remote EJB calls do work from App Client.  
    * **Once the Web Profile TCK has been published, I will work toward getting an estimate for when this critical path issue will be resolved.**

### Jakarta EE 11

* Core Profile   
  * Specification page update now live  
  * TCK Maven central artifact published  
  * Update from Ivar.  
  * Job: [https://ci.eclipse.org/jakartaee-platform/job/stage-tck-artifacts-manual-job/](https://ci.eclipse.org/jakartaee-platform/job/stage-tck-artifacts-manual-job/)   
  * Status: still working on it. Currently blocked. ACTION: Ed to follow up with Ivar.  
  *   
      
* Validation 3.1 API  
  * Validation implementation cannot go final until some files are added / updated in the API jar.    
  * When will we get a new 3.1.1 release of the API?  
    * [https://github.com/jakartaee/validation/pull/221](https://github.com/jakartaee/validation/pull/221) appears to be the PR that is needed for a 3.1.1 updated API artifact  
  * ACTION: Ed to chase down Validation committer to get this merged.

* SecurityManager concerns about some component specifications still having language  and API usage of the Security Manager  
  * ACTION: Ed has a PR to update the platform specification for component specification language regarding SecurityManager.  
  * API usage of SecurityManager requires a minor spec release at a minimum and is being looked to to do in EE 12\.  We are not going to do new release plans for component specifications for EE 11\.

### Jakarta EE 12

* ACTION: Ed to nominate Jared as a platform committer for Jakarta EE 12\.   
* Yes, the security manager discussion is lively now. Let’s keep it up.  
  * Will be a priority for EE 12 and will need to get issues opened against appropriate component specifications  
* Start gathering cross-cutting concerns so that we can advise the component specifications.  
  * Examples:  
    * Remove all SecuityManager.  
    * Accept the usage of CDI.  
  * EE12 Issues: [https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3AEE12](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3AEE12)   
    

* TCK Work  
  * For 12, define an architecture for where tests are **best** located.  Either in the component repository or in the platform TCK repository depending on the nature of the test.  
    * Arjan suggested this can be done with EJB and tags to move the tests  
    * Jan talked about the need to look at dependency tree to determine if tests can move or not  
* Data 1.1 has a release plan drafted.  Nathan will follow up with the Data community to determine if they are ready for plan review.
