## Top of mind for Jared, James

* Ballot for combining Platform and TCK projects has completed and is approved.  The results of the ballot are documented [here](https://www.eclipse.org/lists/jakartaee-platform-dev/msg04811.html).  
* OSSRH update  
  * Parent POM experimental update has been merged to allow for playing with the new plugin, but we still have limitations with the current implementation.   
    * A 2.0.0-SNAPSHOT version was created successfully.  
    * [This Jenkins job](https://ci.eclipse.org/ee4j/job/ee4j-parent-release-snapshot/) was the one used.  
    * Servlet and others have moved to using the snapshot version.  See [this PR](https://github.com/jakartaee/servlet/pull/924) for an example.  
  * The Release Engineering (RelEng) team has put out a latest status on OSSRH migration [here](https://www.eclipse.org/lists/cross-project-issues-dev/msg20066.html).  There is a lot of good information in that mail.  The latest status is still being tracked in [this issue](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipsefdn/helpdesk/-/issues/5854).  
* [3 new JBoss CCRs for EE 10](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3Acertification) were created a week and a half ago  
* Ballot for including Jakarta Query into the Platform and Web Profile was started.  See the details [here](https://www.eclipse.org/lists/jakartaee-platform-dev/msg04812.html).  Please vote.  
* AI and Jakarta blog post is finalizing and should be published in the next week likely.  The proposed content is [here](%20%20https://gist.github.com/edburns/76062d7c780d16b9aaa4cf2590a4776c%20).

## Jakarta EE 12

* [https://github.com/orgs/jakartaee/projects/20/views/1](https://github.com/orgs/jakartaee/projects/20/views/1) dashboard populated with M1 issues for each spec with an update for EE 12\.  
  * Aiming for October 15 for completion for M1  
  * Main concern is publishing  
  * M1 releases of the API are available for both activation and mail  
* Jakarta and MicroProfile Update  
  * Last week’s MP meeting covered  
    * OSSRH support  
    * Possible MP 7.2 release

## Jakarta EE 11

* Will need to update EE 11 TCK to use the new parent POM and make a snapshot release of TCK 11.0.2 version to validate the changes.
