* HTTP/3 [https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/issues/1038](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/issues/1038) (e.g. this is about how the HTTP client interacts with the server using HTTP/3)

    * Push it down to the component spec level.  
      * Servlet.  
      * REST.  
      * HTTP  
    * State it at the platform level, including a TCK test.  
    * We must also plan for this to be dealt with separately from the Jakarta HTTP proposal.  [https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/issues/673](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/issues/673)   
    * Leave to be defined as a vendor concern.  
  * There is a JEP for HTTP/3 Client  [https://openjdk.org/jeps/8291976](https://openjdk.org/jeps/8291976)   
* Marlow: TCK assertion approaches which may have been mentioned above?  
  * [https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/issues/2006](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/issues/2006) is for \`Introduce TCK AssertionId annotation\` to provide a way to specify test assertions in TCK tests.

### TCK Refactoring Jakarta EE 11

### Jakarta EE 12

* Plan review ballot status [https://github.com/orgs/jakartaee/projects/17](https://github.com/orgs/jakartaee/projects/17)   
* Note: Jakarta Config does not need a “plan review”, so it is not on the board. It does need a “progress review” to accommodate the Config aspect of “Host MicroProfile at Jakarta”.   
  [https://jakarta.ee/specifications/config/1.0/](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/config/1.0/)   
* Jakarta HTTP  
  * Mailing list communication to platform, rest and servlet hasn’t happened yet

  * [Web Profile](https://deploy-preview-828--jakartaee-specifications.netlify.app/specifications/webprofile/12/)  
  * [Platform](https://deploy-preview-829--jakartaee-specifications.netlify.app/specifications/platform/12/)  
* Review where components specs are on the board  
* Marlow: Can we work on getting more involvement with running EE Specifications?  
  * We have spec leads that are still leading multiple EE Specifications.  Can we work on process to improve the situation to encourage others to step up and help?
