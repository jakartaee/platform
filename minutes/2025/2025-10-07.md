## Top of mind for Jared, James

* Ballot for including Jakarta Query into the Platform and Web Profile was started and it completes next Monday.  See the details [here](https://www.eclipse.org/lists/jakartaee-platform-dev/msg04812.html).  Please vote.  
* OSSRH update  
  * So far people are using snapshots to “stage” their M1 binaries.  
  * Snapshots last 90 days, but we still need a real snapshot mechanism when we get to doing release reviews.  
  * Should we just keep with the Parent POM 2.0.0-SNAPSHOT or actually publish a 2.0.0 since the snapshot will be gone after 90 days?  
    * [Servlet PR](https://github.com/jakartaee/servlet/pull/924/files) for switching to the snapshot parent POM.  They had to add some things in order get it working.  Some things maybe should be moved up to the parent POM to not require each project to have to do it.  
    * Kyle will make a PR to try to add those to the parent POM to see if do not need to have in their component pom.xml files.  
    * Auto publish being set to true appears to be necessary right now.  
    * Right now committers do not have access to do the publish  
    * The replacement maven plugin that is being worked on to help solve the staging problem also addresses these access issues  
* The AI and Jakarta blog post is published [here](https://jakarta.ee/blogs/open-standard-enterprise-java-and-ai/).

## Jakarta EE 12

* [https://github.com/orgs/jakartaee/projects/20/views/1](https://github.com/orgs/jakartaee/projects/20/views/1) dashboard populated with M1 issues for each spec with an update for EE 12\.  
  * Aiming for October 15 for completion for M1  
  * Main concern is publishing  
  * M1 releases of the API are available for both activation and mail  
  * Data and Concurrency have plans to make their M1 API this week  
  * Jakarta Validation  
    * [https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipsefdn/helpdesk/-/issues/6716](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipsefdn/helpdesk/-/issues/6716) describes problem with publishing Jakarta Validation SNAPSHOTs to Maven Central  
    * [https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/ee4j/pull/103](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/ee4j/pull/103) is for addressing ^   
      * Thanks Marko Bekhta\!  
      * Similar to what is discussed above in Top of Mind.  Kyle will make similar updates with additional things possibly in the distributionManagement section  
* Jakarta and MicroProfile Update  
  * No quorum at MP steering committee last week  
  * Was rescheduled to a week from today  
* AI use for developing specifications  
  * APIs, TCKs and specification language changes can be assisted by AI  
  * [https://www.eclipse.org/projects/guidelines/genai](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/guidelines/genai) is the eclipse AI policy  
  * When putting in a change, need to include information that AI was used to assist in developing the change  
  * Are we concerned about the source of the code that is provided by the GenAI?  Where did it come from?  Was it from copyright code?  Appears to be no allow / block list of AI tools in the guidelines above.  
* Make EE specifications more discoverable by search engines and AI  
  * [Marko Bekhta](mailto:mbekhta@redhat.com) commented on [https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/issues/1108\#issuecomment-3369342407](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/issues/1108#issuecomment-3369342407) to prefer the latest spec release be referenced from each existing spec.  
    * “about the canonical URL in the spec HTMLs ... since the content of the spec from version to version contains a lot of "duplicated content" it probably wouldn't help much if we just point to the spec page of the same version (I was looking at the patches applied to some of the projects so far).. instead if we could have a current version, e.g. https://jakarta.ee/specifications/bean-validation/current/jakarta-validation-spec and then all other versions pointing to the current version in their canonical link that would be better. For that though we'd have to set up the redirect and then make sure that once we release the new spec version the redirect from current to that new version is updated.”  
    * [https://github.com/jakartaee/data/pull/1138](https://github.com/jakartaee/data/pull/1138)  
      * The ask is for each doc to point back to a URL to itself  
      * Having every version pointing back to the latest seems wrong  
      * Won’t doing searching show only the latest then always and lose the access to the previous versions?  
      * What is being asked is what the eclipse web team came up with.  If we want to do something else we need to follow up with them.  
* Platform TCK  
  * All excluded tests have been re-enabled as requested in the M1 issue.  Those tests will fail until they are fixed since likely they were test issues.

## Jakarta EE 11

* Will need to update EE 11 TCK to use the new parent POM and making a snapshot release of TCK 11.0.2 version to validate the changes.  
* Arquillian 11.1.2 release was created to fix some things for the TCK.  arquillian-protocol-common was the major one that needed a fix.
